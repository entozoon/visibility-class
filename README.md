# Visibility Class

Adds a visible/invisible class to chosen elements as you scroll.

## Install

    npm i visibility-class

## Integrate

You're likely gonna wanna import and compile it, as it's written in ES6 (because life is short).

```js
import visibilityClass from "visibility-class";
visibilityClass(".visibility-class");
```

```html
<section class="visibility-class"></section>
```

## That's all well and good, but what does it do?

As you scroll down, it'll add a class of `visible` or `invisible` to your chosen elements.

```html
<section class="visibility-class visible"></section>
```
